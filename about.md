I don't understand how the world or life works, but I'm curious, and I like living.

# Work

I am a sophomore in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at IIIT Gwalior, focusing on iOS Development and Efficient Use of LLM's. I’m passionate about building intuitive and efficient applications, and I’m particularly drawn to projects that combine theory with hands-on implementation—whether it’s contributing to open-source, designing system architectures, or optimizing code performance.
