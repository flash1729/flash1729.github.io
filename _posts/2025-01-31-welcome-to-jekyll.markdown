<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk]. -->

<!-- Since a lot of time I felt that my head is spammed with numerous thoughts which I want to be alligned with reality and try to link them all up to create beautiful ideas So to achieve this I am writing a blog.

There are several reasons behind this decision. Firstly, I want to become a better thinker and speaker. Funny enough, I even considered starting a "Thinking Company" where people or big companies could come to us with their problems, and we would provide creative solutions. Writing is one of the greatest ways to understand your thought process.

I am learing to make people read what I write and allign their thinking with my thought process through my words...

I often feel like my head is filled with numerous thoughts that I want to align with reality. By linking these thoughts together, I hope to create beautiful ideas. To achieve this, I've decided to start writing a blog.

There are several reasons behind this decision. Firstly, I want to become a better thinker and speaker. Funny enough, I even considered starting a "Thinking Company" where people or big companies could come to us with their problems, and we would provide creative solutions. Writing is one of the greatest ways to understand your thought process.

Moreover, I want to learn how to engage readers and align their thinking with my thought process through my words. It's a cool thing to say, and let's see where this writing journey takes us.

If you've read this post and would like to chat, you can find my email on the site. You can also reach me on Discord at `flash1729`.



> Peace! (I don't know why I wrote this, but it felt right.)
